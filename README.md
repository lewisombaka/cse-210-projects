# cse210-ww-Lewis_Ochieng'_Ombaka-template

This repository contains the starter code for many different projects. They are arranged as follows:

* `sandbox` - An empty project that you can use to play around with any concepts you like.
* `csharp-prep` - Starter projects for each of the C# Prep assignments.
* `prepare` - Starter projects for each of the preparation Learning Activities.
* `prove` - Starter projects for each of the prove Developer projects.
* `foundation` - Starter projects for foundation projects.


1. **Meaning** - Version control manages and tracks changes to files, enabling collaboration, preserving file history, and supporting easy reversion to previous versions. Systems like Git allow branching, merging, and efficient teamwork on projects.

2. **Benefit** - Version control enhances collaboration, tracks file history, provides backups, supports branching and merging, and ensures accountability for changes.

3. **Application** - An example of version control is Git, used by developers to track code changes, create branches for features, and collaborate via platforms like GitHub.

4. **Length** - The principle of version control is centered around managing changes to files over time, ensuring that every modification is tracked and saved. It allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously by creating different versions (or "snapshots") of the files. With version control, changes are stored in a repository, where users can view the history of edits, identify who made each change, and revert to earlier versions if needed. Systems like Git enable branching, allowing developers to work on different features independently before merging them back into the main codebase. This ensures efficient collaboration, reduces the risk of conflicts, and provides a safety net against data loss or errors.

5. Contains a git command - 
            - `git init`: Creates a new Git repository.
            - `git add <file>`: Stages changes for the next commit.
            - `git commit -m "message"`: Saves staged changes with a message.
            - `git status`: Shows current changes and branch status.
            - `git log`: Lists commit history.
            - `git branch`: Lists all branches.
            - `git checkout <branch>`: Switches branches.
            - `git merge <branch>`: Combines changes from another branch.
            - `git pull`: Updates local repository with remote changes.
            - `git push`: Uploads local changes to the remote repository.
